This project is a window to learn CSP problems in AI. We are going to use backtracking search and other hurestic algorithms to try and solve a sudoku puzzle.
Algorithms used in this project are based on chapter 5 of "Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach", 4th Edition.

ps: This is my first time using python and Tkinter. This project is both a homework for my AI class and a way for me to learn python.
